# rps-js

This is an updated version of my Rock Paper Scissors page from The Odin Project. As it was my first JavaScript project, I wanted to go back and have a separate, new repository to gauge progress. Instead of looking at past commits, I chose to have something visual to see differences between.

For this iteration, I focused on practicing making the page responsive to different screen sizes, google lighthouse scores, and organizing/condensing code to become more managable. Additionally, I have been on a CSS kick and wanted to explore uses since as linear-gradients and @media queries to understand breakpoints more.
